<p><span class="fn">TED:</span> Okay, let’s see. I studied film in college and after earning my degree, I lived in San Francisco where I started working in postproduction for film and video. I was at a nonprofit that offered training and did independent and gallery-circuit film and video work. I got my start there, and it was a great introduction to the arts community in San Francisco.</p>

<p>It was around that time that I met Angie. She was in a program where I was working, and we had also known of each other through hanging out in similar circles. Right after we met, I left San Francisco and traveled for a year. While I was gone, Angie took over my job, unbeknownst to me. When I returned, we ran into each other at a mutual friend’s gallery show, and we just clicked. The funny part is that I didn’t know what I was going to do for work when I returned to San Francisco; I was sort of floating around, but then I got my old job back. That evening at the show, I talked with Angie and told her, “Hey, I got my job back,” and she replied, “Oh, I got fired today!” (laughing)</p>

<p>“Even though we didn’t think of Poketo as a business at first, we couldn’t help but ask, ‘What else do we want in our lives? How can we extend this idea of art for everyday living?’”</p>

<p class="q"><strong>That is really funny. What happened next?</strong></p>
<p><span class="fn">TED:</span> Angie and I started dating and she went back to school to study graphic design at California College of Arts (CCA). We started Poketo shortly after that. Many of our friends were participating in art shows, but not selling much work. We wanted to throw art shows, get our friends together, and have a lot of fun—we weren’t thinking of it as a business.</p>

<p>For our first event in 2003, we rented a space in San Francisco for a weekend. We had invited our artist friends to make a product, which was the Poketo wallet, and over the course of two days, we had musician and DJ friends play music during the evening. We thought it would be a good way to show art and also give people something to walk away with at the end of the night. At the time, none of us had money to buy original art, but this was a way for people to enjoy art and leave without spending too much money. We had the event, put original artwork up on the wall, and artists contributed artwork for the wallets. We had made the wallets at Angie’s school where we spent several days and late nights using the Epson printer. People were flipping out over the product we had made, and they sold out that night. It wasn’t just a fun weekend; it was one of those magic moments. When it was over and we walked back to our studio, we had butterflies in our stomachs. It was amazing!</p>

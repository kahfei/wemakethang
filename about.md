Been a big interviews addict, especially those interviewing creative people - people that make stuffs thru code, arts or digital media. I have subscribed to a bunch of sites[1]. There are all awesomes interview sites :-)


Inevitably at some point, I thought it will be interesting to start an interview site of my own,  covering makers around this region[2] as a start, talking to them to get to know about their stories, tools or workflows.


This site is built with jekyll, mainly as a reason to dabble with it. To get things out real quick (fail fast learn fast, ;-)), I used bootstrap for styling, the lovely factory logo coming from Noun project https://thenounproject.com/search/?q=factory&i=605, google fonts (namely libre baskerville and montserrat) while heavyly drawing inspiration from the awesome 100daysoffonts http://100daysoffonts.com/index.html for design.

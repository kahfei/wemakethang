<p>Have been a big interviews addict for a while now. I like to listen or read interviews with creative people - people that make stuffs thru code, arts or digital media. I subscribed to a long list of interview sites, most of them podcast, a few in text form[1]. All great interview sites with interesting people. </p>

<p>Inevitably at some point, I thought it will be interesting to start an interview site of my own. I will focus on makers around this region[2] as a start, talking to them to get to know about their stories, tools or workflows.</p>

<p>As for the slang "thang" in the name, there is only one reason for that, wemakething.com already been taken up, so wemakethang.com is the next best thang :-)</p>


<p>I built this site with jekyll, mainly as an excuse to dabble with it. To get things out real quick (fail fast learn fast, ;-)), I used <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">bootstrap</a> for css framework, the lovely factory logo coming from <a href="https://thenounproject.com/search/?q=factory&i=605">Noun project</a> , <a href="https://www.google.com/fonts">google fonts</a> (namely libre baskerville and montserrat) while heavily drawing inspiration from the awesome <a href="ttp://100daysoffonts.com/index.html">100daysoffonts</a> for design.</p> 

<p>If these sound interesting to you, please drop your email here to get all the latest updates. I promised I don't do spam :-).
